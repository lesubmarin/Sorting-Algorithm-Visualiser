# Sorting Algorithm Visualisation

This is a simple program written in C++ using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for visualising sorting algorithms. The program generates a random array of integers and shows the sorting process step by step.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- SDL2 library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have SDL2 installed. If not, follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the SDL2 website: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.

## Usage
- Run the compiled executable.
- The program will open a window displaying a visualisation of the sorting algorithm. You can watch the sorting process in real-time.
- The console will display information about each iteration of the sorting algorithm, including the iteration count and total time elapsed.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
