# Sorting Algorithm Visualisation

Welcome to Sorting Algorithm Visualisation! This program, written in C++ using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), allows you to visually observe various sorting algorithms in action. Watch as the program generates a random array of integers and illustrates the sorting process step by step.

## Requirements
To use this program, ensure you have the following:
- A C++ compiler
- SDL2 library

## Installation
Follow these steps to get started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure SDL2 is installed. If not, refer to the installation instructions for your operating system on the [SDL2 website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.

## Usage
Here's how to use the program:
- Run the compiled executable.
- A window will open, displaying a visualisation of the sorting algorithm in action.
- Observe the sorting process in real-time.
- Check the console for information about each iteration, including the iteration count and total elapsed time.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
### Real Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Pseudo Algorithms
- Bogo Sort
- Stalin Sort
